# Flight Delay Prediction Project

## Introduction

The Flight Delay Prediction Project is designed to forecast delays in flights by analyzing various historical flight data features. With the help of machine learning algorithms, we can sift through past flight performance data and derive meaningful insights, enabling us to make informed predictions about future delays.

## Project Overview

This project is structured in a systematic manner, following a series of essential steps to ensure the successful development of the prediction model.

### 1. Data Loading

The journey begins with the **loading of a dataset** that contains comprehensive historical flight information. This dataset encompasses a wide range of attributes, including flight ID, departure and arrival stations, flight status, and relevant timestamps. This foundational step sets the stage for the analysis that follows.

### 2. Basic Data Exploration

Once the data is loaded, we proceed to the **basic data exploration** phase. Here, we delve into the dataset to gain an understanding of its structure. We identify potential issues and scrutinize the presence of missing values. This crucial assessment of data quality informs the necessary preprocessing steps we need to undertake.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Next, we enter the **data preprocessing** stage. This step involves several key activities:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are carefully addressed to uphold the integrity of the dataset. For instance, missing values in the target variable, which represents flight delays, are filled with the mean or median delay to ensure we have a complete dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: We derive new features from the existing data, such as extracting the day, month, and year from the flight date. This feature engineering helps us capture the temporal patterns that significantly influence flight delays.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical features like departure and arrival stations are transformed into numerical representations through a process called one-hot encoding. This transformation is vital, as it enables machine learning models to leverage these features effectively.

### 4. Splitting the Data

Having prepared the data, we move on to **splitting the dataset** into training and testing sets. This split is crucial for evaluating the performance of our predictive models. Typically, we allocate 80% of the data for training and reserve 20% for testing, ensuring that we can accurately assess how well our models generalize to unseen data.

### 5. Model Training

The core of the project lies in the **model training** phase, where we develop two machine learning models:

- **Linear Regression**: We utilize this fundamental algorithm, which assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. It serves as a robust method for predicting flight delays based on input features.

- **Random Forest Regressor**: This model employs an ensemble learning approach by constructing multiple decision trees and combining their outputs for more accurate predictions. It excels in handling complex datasets and capturing non-linear relationships that may exist among features.

### 6. Model Evaluation

After training our models, we enter the **model evaluation** phase. Here, we assess the performance of our models using several key metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This metric measures the average magnitude of errors in our predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, offering insights into the accuracy of our predictions.
- **R-squared Score**: This score indicates how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable, providing an overall measure of model performance.

### 7. Visualization of Results

To further analyze our models, we incorporate **visualization techniques**. We create scatter plots to compare actual versus predicted delays, allowing us to visually assess model performance. Additionally, bar charts displaying feature importance provide insight into which factors significantly influence flight delays, enhancing our understanding of the modelâ€™s behavior.

### 8. Making Predictions

Finally, we develop an interactive function that allows users to input flight details and receive predictions regarding potential delays. This user-friendly component significantly enhances the model's practicality and accessibility for real-world applications.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project highlights the effective application of machine learning techniques to predict flight delays using historical flight data. By systematically processing the data, training models, and evaluating their performance, we gain valuable insights into the factors influencing flight punctuality. The combination of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor establishes a robust framework for making accurate predictions. Future enhancements could include deploying the model for real-time predictions and exploring additional features to improve accuracy further.
