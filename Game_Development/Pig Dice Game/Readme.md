# Pig Dice Game

A simple command-line implementation of the **Pig Dice Game** in Python. Two players take turns rolling a die, racing to reach 100 points. The game has a risk/reward mechanic where rolling a 1 results in losing all points for the current turn.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns to roll a die.
2. On each roll, if the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they score nothing for that turn.
3. If the player rolls a 2-6, they can choose to roll again or "hold".
4. If the player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their overall score, and their turn ends.
5. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
