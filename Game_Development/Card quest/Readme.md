Card Quest
🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create an engaging card game application that allows users to enjoy and practice various classic card games using Python.

🧾 Description
Card Quest is an interactive application built using Python, designed to provide users with a fun way to play and learn card games. The tool features a variety of games that encourage strategic thinking, memory, and basic arithmetic, all while allowing for multiplayer interaction and competitive play.

🧮 What I Accomplished

Developed a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to select and play different card games.
Implemented functionality for multiple classic card games, providing an enjoyable experience for players of all ages and skill levels.
🚀 Games Implemented

Blackjack: A popular casino game where players aim to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Players must decide whether to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current hand) while competing against a dealer.

War: A simple yet thrilling game where two players flip cards simultaneously, and the player with the higher card wins. The game continues until one player collects all the cards or until players decide to stop.

Higher or Lower: A guessing game where players try to predict whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current card. Correct guesses keep the game going, while an incorrect guess ends the game.

Memory: A classic game where players try to match pairs of cards by remembering their positions. Players take turns revealing two cards at a time, aiming to find matching pairs.

Go Fish: A fun game where players ask each other for cards of a specific rank to form pairs. If the opponent doesn’t have the requested card, they say “Go Fish,” prompting the player to draw from the deck.

Lucky Sevens: A quick game where players draw three cards and see if their total equals exactly seven. It’s a simple way to test luck and arithmetic skills.

📚 Libraries Needed

Random: For shuffling and dealing cards in various games.
OS: For file management operations, if needed for future extensions.
📢 Conclusion
Card Quest serves as an entertaining introduction to classic card games, showcasing interactive play and strategic decision-making. This project provides a fun way for users to engage with friends and family while honing their skills in a relaxed environment.
